Build and deploy Swift Package Manager projects on AWS Lambda.

`swift lambda` builds Swift projects using the
[Swift AWS Lambda Runtime](https://github.com/swift-server/swift-aws-lambda-runtime)
for deployment into
[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
functions. 
It uses a Swift
[cross compilation toolchain](https://github.com/SPMDestinations/homebrew-tap)
for
[Amazon Linux](https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-2/) 
to build the project right on macOS, no Docker required.
Simply call `swift lambda build`.

A built Swift lambda can then be deployed using `swift lambda deploy`
(using either `aws lambda publish` or `sam deploy`).

Blog article: [Deploying Swift on AWS Lambda](http://www.alwaysrightinstitute.com/macrolambda/).

Note: Due to a [bug](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-13312) 
      in Xcode 11's Swift 5.2.4, a Swift 5.3 install (e.g. Xcode beta 12) is 
      currently required.


## Installation

First make sure `swift --version` shows a 5.3 release, it is currently required.

`swift lambda` is easiest to install using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh),
get it [over here](https://brew.sh).

This single call installs `swift lambda` and all its dependencies:
```bash
$ brew install SPMDestinations/tap/swift-lambda
```

> It's a pretty big download at over 1GB (binary host & target Swift toolchains
> from [Swift.org](https://swift.org/download/#releases) and the
> [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)).


## Usage

A simple Swift Lambda using
[Macro](https://github.com/Macro-swift/MacroLambda).

Setup the Swift package:
```swift
mkdir HelloWorld && cd HelloWorld
swift package init --type executable
open Package.swift # opens Xcode
```

Configure the `Package.swift` to look like this:
```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.2
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
  name         : "HelloWorld",
  platforms    : [ .macOS(.v10_13) ], // <== add this
  dependencies : [ // and add this dependency â†“
    .package(url: "https://github.com/Macro-swift/MacroLambda.git",
             from: "0.1.3"),
    .package(url: "https://github.com/AlwaysRightInstitute/cows.git",
             from: "1.0.0") // optional but fun
  ],
  targets: [
    .target(name: "HelloWorld", 
            dependencies: [ "MacroLambda", "cows" ])
  ]
)
```

Fill in the Lambda's code in the `main.swift`:

```swift
import MacroLambda

let app = Express()
app.use(bodyParser.text())

app.post("/hello") { req, res, next in
  res.send("Client sent: \(req.body.text ?? "~nothing~")")
}

app.get { req, res, next in
  res.send("Welcome to Macro!\n")
}

if process.isRunningInLambda {
  Lambda.run(app)
}
else {
  app.listen(1337) {
    console.log("server running on http://localhost:1337/")
  }
}
```

Build the package using `swift lambda build` and deploy it to AWS by
calling `swift lambda deploy`. 
It expects a Lambda configuration called `HelloWorld` (select a different
function using the `-f` argument).

A more complex example:
[express-simple-lambda](https://github.com/Macro-swift/Examples/tree/feature/lambda-express-1/Sources/express-simple-lambda),
it looks like this:

## Usage: `swift lambda build`

```
$ swift lambda build -h
Unknown argument: -h

usage: swift lambda build [mode] [options]

Modes:
  -c, --configuration debug|release [default: debug]
  --clean build|dist                [default: build]

Product:
  -p, --product <product>           [default: directory name]
  -d, --destination <dest>

Options:
  -v, --verbose
  -s, --silent
  --static
  --static-libs <libs>

```

## Usage: `swift lambda deploy`

```
$ swift lambda deploy -h
usage: swift lambda deploy [options]

  -f, --function <name>
  -p, --product  <product>
  -t, --template <SAM template>     (optional)
  --stack-name   <SAM stackname>    (optional)

If no function/product name is provided, the current directory
will be used.

Build Options:
  --skip-build                      (do not invoke swift lambda build)
  -c, --configuration debug|release [default: debug]
  -d, --destination <dest>
  --static
  --static-libs <libs>

Options:
  -v, --verbose
  -s, --silent

```


## Issues & Caveats

- Swift 5.3 required on host ([SR-13312](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-13312))
- There is no "direct" Xcode support yet, i.e. the package needs to be
  created using a `Package.swift` (vs create a new tool project in Xcode).
  We might address that and even provide a SwiftXcode style Lambda Xcode
  template. Direct deployment from within Xcode should be possible.
  ([Issue 2](https://github.com/SwiftXcode/swift-lambda/issues/2))
- C++ support seems b0rked right now. Regular C code compile just fine
  (e.g. SwiftNIO includes some). 
  ([SPMDestinations Issue #4](https://github.com/SPMDestinations/homebrew-tap/issues/4))
- `swift lambda build` has some support for static linking already builtin,
  but it doesn't fully work yet. To be fixed.
  (static linking reduces the size of the zip and further improves Lambda
   startup time).
  ([Issue 3](https://github.com/SwiftXcode/swift-lambda/issues/3))
- There is no Swift 5.3 toolchain for Amazon Linux yet (just 5.2).
  ([SPMDestinations Issue #5](https://github.com/SPMDestinations/homebrew-tap/issues/5))
- The X toolchains only have the packages that seemed necessary. If someone
  needs additionals ones please file an issue (the toolchains can carry lots
  of dev packages, that's perfectly fine).
